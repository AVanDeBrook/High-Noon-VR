# High-Noon-VR
A VR target shooter style game that was developed from scratch at the Hack-Riddle hackathon held at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
This game was created by Bryce Cole and Aaron Van De Brook within 24 hours using C#, models used were either created using Maya or third party libraries.

This game ended up taking 2nd Place overall at the hackathon.

Bryce Cole handled mainly the programming and worked on some of the terrain design.

Aaron Van De Brook worked mainly on 3D modeling some of the objects in the game as well as designing the terrain in the background of the game.

The game was made in VR using Unity, and was developed and meant to be used with/plaed on a Samsung Gear VR headset.

We used Maya, Blender, Unity, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code to model and program the game.
